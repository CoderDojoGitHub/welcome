# Hello!

This organization is the home of CoderDojo San Francisco on Github. We use this space for storing lesson plans and communication between mentors.

## What is CoderDojo?

CoderDojo is a global movement of open-source, volunteer led coding clubs, providing free classes to kids between the ages of 6 and 16.

## I'm interested in signing my children up

Great! Head over to [our website](http://coderdojosf.com) to see upcoming events. Registration for events opens *seven days* in advance and fill quickly. If you're interested in being notified when registration opens, you may "subscribe" to an event. You'll receive a single email the moment registration opens.

## I'm interested in keeping tabs on what you're doing

Also great! There are a few ways to keep in touch:

* [Sign up for our Announcements mailing list](http://coderdojosf.com/#newsletter) (we'll only email you periodically, and only when it's about upcoming events)
* [Follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/coderdojosf)
* [Chat with us in our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/coderdojo-sanfran)
* [Send us an email](sanfran@coderdojo.com)

## I'm interested in mentoring

Even more great! Volunteer mentors are what makes running the dojo possible. The best way to get in touch is by emailing us at sanfran@coderdojo.com

What can I do as a mentor?

* Show up to classes to mentor students
* Provide feedback on lesson plans as they're being created
* Lead the effort to create a class curriculum
* Teach a class, either an existing lesson or one that you've written yourself
* Assist in the day-to-day running of the dojo
